ðŸ”§ Project Description: Dual Voltage Regulator Circuit Design in KiCad (2-Layer PCB)

This project focused on designing a dual-output voltage regulator PCB using KiCad, capable of supplying both 5V and 3.3V regulated outputs from a single input source. The board was built around linear voltage regulators (e.g., AMS1117 or LM7805) and included essential components such as input/output capacitors, reverse polarity protection, and power indicator LEDs.

A complete schematic was created, followed by a 2-layer PCB layout optimized for thermal dissipation, component accessibility, and efficient power distribution. Special attention was given to proper grounding, trace widths for current handling, and separation of the two regulated sections.

The design was validated through thorough ERC (Electrical Rule Check) and DRC (Design Rule Check) to ensure it was error-free and ready for fabrication. Final deliverables included Gerber files, a BOM, and fabrication-ready outputs.

This project demonstrates skills in power supply design, circuit protection, and proficient use of KiCad for schematic capture and PCB layout.
